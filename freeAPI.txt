the city is placed immediatly after the "="
for cities with a space in them like New York, Mountain View. by url standards the spaces should be replaced with "%20"
with this you will get a feedback like this "[{"title":"Lagos","location_type":"City","woeid":1398823,"latt_long":"6.439180,3.423480"}]"


this is not helpful in building a weather profile. However, the good take away form the array is that it gives us a "woeid" aka "where on earth ID" this ID is now useful to get the full weather information.
